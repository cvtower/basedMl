# Oreilly-Learning-TensorFlow

### Content (book chapters):
1.  Introduction -- no code 
# Oreilly-OSCON2017-Learning-TensorFlow
Code and slides for the 2-day TensorFlow training at OSCON 2017 https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57856

code to accompany blog posts  

1. [Transfer learning from multiple pre-trained computer vision models](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/transfer-learning-from-multiple-pre-trained-computer-vision-models)
In this short blog post I describe the (somewhat under-utilized) method of combining multiple pre-trained cv models using stacking, to enhance classification results on a new dataset. 

2.  Go with the Flow: Up and Running with TensorFlow
3.  Understanding TensorFlow Basics
4.  Convolutional Neural Networks
5.  Text I: Working with Text and Sequences, and TensorBoard Visualization.
6.  Text II: Word Vectors, Advanced RNN, and Embedding Visualization.
7.  TensorFlow Abstractions and Simplications.
8.  Queues, Threads, and Reading Data.
9.  Distributed TensorFlow.
10. Exporting and Serving Models with TensorFlow.
